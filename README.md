# 12-weeks-workshop-challenge

A hands on experience journey in the AWS cloud inspired by Prasad Rao (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kprasadrao/) in his LinkedIn post https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7044291636020834304/.

The 12 weeks workshop challenge is created to help cloud enthusiasts (like myself https://www.linkedin.com/in/ernie-carnate-62445996/) gain deep hands-on expertise on AWS.

It is a collection of self-paced workshops developed by experts at AWS and is curated to help you to gain expertise in AWS gradually.

These workshops range from beginner-level to advanced, and the best part is that you can follow them at your own pace, whenever it suits you.

By spending just 2-6 hours every week, you'll gain practical skills, techniques, and concepts that you can use to solve business problems and strengthen your resume to showcase your cloud skills.

So what are you waiting for? Let's go thru the challenge...
